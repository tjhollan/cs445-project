# Term Project

This is the project for the class CS445 - Machine Learning from Spring of 2022. It explores the idea of specialized training for neural networks to classify images. I used the MNIST data set to first get an idea of how the process would work, with the intention to expand to other classification problems once I was able to get a working model set up.
